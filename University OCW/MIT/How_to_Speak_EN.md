The thing you must take from this note, Quality equals to `<great amount of Knowledge> * <certain practice> * <a tiny of talent>`

## How to Start

### Yes

* **Promise**: Promise your audience what will they take after your talk
* Example:  At the end of this note, you’ll have a conceptual layout of presentation flow and understand how to use some techniques that you don’t know now to succeed a speak.

### No

* **Joke**: People just start to put their things away and pay attention on you, **they haven’t ready for a joke**.

## Samples

* **Cycle**: To make sure everyone knows your topic, you need to tell them a third time, in case they fogged out in the process.
* **Build Fence**: So that others won’t confuse your ideas with something similar.
* **Verbal Punctuation**: Write down or present your outline so that people can find a landmark when fogged out in the process and come back.
* **Question**: Wait for seven seconds to see if anyone respond. The question can’t be too easy nor too hard, the first make people embarrassed to answer and the second make people don’t know what to answer.

## Time and Space

* **11 AM**: Most people awake at this point and probably won’t get back to sleep.
* **Well lit**: When the light lit, it indicates everyone to be awake.
* **Cased**: Know your challenge case by case, do **know more about your audience**, location’s functionality… etc. So that you can deal with any unexpected situation.
* **Populated**: People often attracted by the crowd, if there’s a good lecture but with few people onsite, others may start to wonder the reason. So, people must be at least half full.

## Board

* **Graphic**: People like to see something visualized, besides you can connect different slides and factors together with graphic
* **Speed**: Slow down your speed and slides so that your audience can absorb your ideas.
* **Target**: Your hand or the mouse pointer if you’re presenting online, which can effectively guide your audience to where they should give attention to.

## Props

* **Empathetic Mirroring**: People put themselves in your shoes if you explain your idea with some props in the process, which make them impressive.

## Job Talks

* **Vision**:
    1.	**Problem somebody care about**. For example: Asking the nature of Human Intelligence.
    2.	**What new in your approach**. For example: Find out what’s the difference between us and chimpanzees or Neanderthals.
* **Done Something**: Listing the steps that need to be taken to achieve the solution of the problem.
* **Contributions**: You can have your own style and ideas in the middle, but talk about your actual contributions at final
* **In 5 Minutes**: Do above in 5 minutes, which impress people enough and don’t waste each other’s time.

## Getting Famous (Ensure your work get recognized)

### Why

You’ll get used to be famous, but never get used to being ignored.

### How

Like a pentagram, there’s 5 points, called 5S.

* **Symbol**: Associate with your work, maybe some kind of props, images, or demonstrations.
* **Slogan**: A good name relate to your work. For example: Quick Takeaways.
* **Surprise**: Don’t need millions of examples, just one, and you need to **use it appropriately**. For example: You can learn all you need in a note rather than a one-hour YouTube video.
* **Salient idea**: An idea that **sticks out**.
* **Story**: How you did it? How it works? Why it’s important?

## How to Stop

* What the best final slide
    * YES
        * Make a conclusion about your contributions.
    * NO
        * Put your collaborator slide at last page. (You should put it at the first page.)
        * Just a slide with a “Questions?” on it.
        * With a demonstration URL
        * Use “The End”, “Thank you”, “Thank you for your listening” for conclusion.
* What the greatest final word
    * YES
        * **Tell a joke**: People already adjust themselves, pay attention on you, so they are ready for a joke.
        * **Benediction**: Say something bless to people. For example: God bless you! God bless NCNU!
        * **Salut to your audience**: Say some words to your audience, the regard and grateful of you to your audience, the feelings to your audience.
    * NO
        * **Thank you, Thank you for listening**: Suggest people stay in place **only because of politeness**. But you can still use “Thank you” in the process, as long as it not the last word.

## Crimes that DO NOT MAKE

* Get rid of background junk. (Best leave with only background color)
* Get rid of logos.
* Get rid of the title.
* Remove bullets on your slides.
* Use a font size that is too small.
* Use laser pointer or related items, which makes you lose contact on your audience.
* Too heavy, too much text, not enough air, not enough white space, not enough imagery. 

## Things you can do to improve your slides

* Review your presentation with layout mode and finding out if there’s too many words.
* Give your slides some air, some white spaces, and some images.
* You can have few pages (3-5 pages) with some texts, but when you come to those pages, remember give your audience time to read.
